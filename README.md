# Graph_Theory_G00337350
It involves writing a program in Python to execute regular expressions on strings using an algorithm known as Thompsonâ€™s construction. You must write a program in the Python programming language that can build a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) from a regular expression, and can use the NFA to check if the regular expression matches any given string of text
